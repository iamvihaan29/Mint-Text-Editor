Mint Text Editor
A minimalist, cross-platform text editor for seamless document creation.
Mint Text Editor is an open-source web application designed to provide a clean and distraction-free writing environment. Built with modern web technologies, it offers a robust set of features for both quick note-taking and professional document editing, all without the need for a complex setup.

Features
Intuitive User Interface: A sleek and responsive design that includes a seamless dark and light mode toggle for optimal viewing in any environment.

Real-Time Metrics: Stay informed with live word and character counts, giving you immediate feedback on your writing progress.

Flexible File Management:

Save As...: Easily save your work to your local machine with a custom filename and a variety of file types, including .txt, .html, and .md.

Load from Clipboard: Quickly import text from other applications by simply pasting it into the dedicated input area.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: As a browser-based application, the editor works flawlessly on any device with a modern web browser.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the foundational structure for the application.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.

Vanilla JavaScript: Powers the application's core logic and interactive features, ensuring fast performance without external libraries.

Getting Started
Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. There's no need to install anything.

Editing and Viewing
Start Typing: The large text area in the middle is your editor. Just start typing, and you'll see your words and characters counted at the bottom.

Change the Theme: The button in the top right corner with the sun/moon icon toggles between dark mode and light mode. Click it to switch the entire app's color scheme.

Saving and Loading Files
Saving: To save your work, click the "Save As..." button. A pop-up will appear where you can give your file a custom name and choose its file type (like .txt, .html, or .md).

Loading: To load text into the editor, you have to use the "Load from Clipboard" box. Just copy the text from another file or document, paste it into that box, and then click the "Load" button. The text will then appear in the main editor. The traditional "Load File" button isn't there anymore because it can cause security issues in some browsers.
